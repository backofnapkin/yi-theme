    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How to Use This Calculator</h2>
    <p>
      This calculator helps you understand how long it will take to accumulate $1 million through your job income, considering various factors like taxes, expenses, and investment returns. It provides realistic projections based on your specific financial situation.
    </p>
    
    <p class="font-semibold mt-4">Start by entering your income details:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Income Type:</strong> Choose between annual salary or hourly wage</li>
      <li><strong>Income Amount:</strong> Enter your pre-tax income (default: $75,000 annually or $17/hour)</li>
      <li><strong>Tax Filing Status:</strong> Select single or married to calculate tax impact</li>
      <li><strong>Monthly Expenses:</strong> Include all regular monthly costs (default: $4,641)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Investment Settings</h3>
    <p>Configure your investment parameters:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Investment Returns:</strong> Set expected annual return rate (0-14%, default: 7%)</li>
      <li><strong>Current Age:</strong> Enter your age to track timeline progress (5-99 years)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Understanding Your Results</h2>
    <p>The calculator provides four different scenarios to reach $1 million:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Gross Income:</strong> Time needed based on total income before taxes</li>
      <li><strong>After Tax Income:</strong> Timeline adjusted for tax impact</li>
      <li><strong>After Taxes + Expenses:</strong> Realistic timeline considering living costs</li>
      <li><strong>Invested Amount:</strong> Accelerated timeline with compound investment returns</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Tax Rate Calculations</h3>
    <p>The calculator uses 2024 tax brackets to estimate your effective tax rate:</p>
    <pre class="bg-skin-card p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto">
<code>Single Tax Brackets:
37% for income over $578,126
35% for income over $231,251
32% for income over $182,101
24% for income over $95,376
22% for income over $44,726
12% for income over $11,001
10% for income up to $11,000

Married Tax Brackets:
37% for income over $693,751
35% for income over $462,501
32% for income over $364,201
24% for income over $190,751
22% for income over $89,451
12% for income over $22,001
10% for income up to $22,000</code>
    </pre>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Investment Return Calculations</h3>
    <p>For invested amounts, the calculator uses compound interest:</p>
    <pre class="bg-skin-card p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto">
<code>// Compound Interest Formula
Future Value = Present Value × (1 + return_rate)^years

// Example with 7% return
$10,000 × (1 + 0.07)^10 = $19,671.51</code>
    </pre>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Strategies to Reach $1 Million Faster</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Increase Savings Rate:</strong> Reduce monthly expenses to invest more</li>
      <li><strong>Optimize Tax Strategy:</strong> Consider tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs</li>
      <li><strong>Boost Income:</strong> Pursue promotions, job changes, or additional education</li>
      <li><strong>Diversify Investments:</strong> Balance risk and return for long-term growth</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Remember that while this calculator provides valuable insights, market returns can vary significantly. Consider running multiple scenarios with different assumptions to better understand potential outcomes.
    </p>
