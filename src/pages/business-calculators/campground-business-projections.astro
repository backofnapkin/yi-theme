    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How to Use the Calculator</h2>
    <p>
      Here's how to use this calculator. For the default settings, I looked for industry data from trusted sources to make the benchmarks more realistic.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Loan Information</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>Initial Purchase Price ($):</strong> Enter the total cost of the campground (Default: $1,000,000). The KOA website says the average cost to buy a campground will range from $100,000 – $2,000,000. (<em>Data Source: <a href="https://ownakoa.com/2023/04/06/how-much-does-it-cost-to-start-a-campground/">https://ownakoa.com/2023/04/06/how-much-does-it-cost-to-start-a-campground/</a></em>)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Down Payment (%):</strong> Specify the percentage you'll pay upfront (Default: 10%). This is a common industry standard for commercial loans, but you may need to put down 20% – 25% if you don't have experience managing a campground business or depending on your specific loan type.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Loan Interest Rate (%):</strong> Enter the annual interest rate on your loan (Default: 6%). These rates will vary on a variety of factors including your credit score and current rates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Loan Term (Years):</strong> Define the loan repayment period (Default: 20 years).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Annual Appreciation Projections (%):</strong> Estimate the annual increase in property value (Default: 3%).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Campground Details</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>Number of Campground Sites:</strong> Total number of rentable sites (Default: 80). KOA recommends <strong>75 to 90 sites</strong> for profitability so I went with a default number in the middle of that range. (<em>Data Source: <a href="https://ownakoa.com/2023/04/06/how-much-does-it-cost-to-start-a-campground/">https://ownakoa.com/2023/04/06/how-much-does-it-cost-to-start-a-campground/</a></em>)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Monthly Rent Per Site ($):</strong> Average monthly fees collected per site each month. (Default: $350).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Additional Services Revenue Per Site ($/month):</strong> Revenue from premium amenities like cable tv, Wi-Fi, laundry services, snacks, vending machines or firewood delivery could all be additional services. I set the default to $100 per month based on this interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-Ysu9Qepgg">the owner of an RV park</a> conducted by Codie Sanchez.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Occupancy Rate (%):</strong> Expected percentage of sites rented (Default: 70%). The average RV park occupancy rate of <strong>60% to 70%</strong> providing a realistic benchmark for revenue potential. (<em>Data Source: <a href="https://www.roverpass.com/blog/rv-park-industry-statistics/">https://www.roverpass.com/blog/rv-park-industry-statistics/</a></em>)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Campground Open Months Per Year:</strong> Number of months the campground operates (Default: 9).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Monthly Costs</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>Monthly Property Management Fee ($):</strong> Costs for onsite staff or management (Default: $10,000). You could also enter your estimated expense of paying all onsite staff in this section.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Monthly Maintenance Costs ($):</strong> Average maintenance expenses (Default: $1,000).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Other Monthly Operating Costs ($):</strong> Miscellaneous operating expenses (Default: $1,000).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-4">What You Need to Know About Campground Revenue</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@kylegrimm">Kyle Grimm</a>, owner of <a href="https://driftwoodquincy.com/">Driftwood Campground and RV Park</a>, a 50-site campground in Quincy, IL, provides real-world insights into maximizing campground profitability. Here are three key lessons that I built into the Campground Revenue Calculator based on Kyle's direct experience. This information can help a lot with the accuracy of your inputs for this tool so don't overlook it.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">1. Understand the Expense Ratio</h3>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Kyle emphasizes the importance of knowing your expense ratio to manage costs effectively: <em>"If we make $100,000 a year gross… you can plan on a campground like ours to operate at somewhere between a 50 and 60 percent expense ratio."</em>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      This means that for every dollar earned, $0.50 to $0.60 is spent on operating costs like utilities, lawn care, taxes, and insurance. This insight directly ties to the <strong>"Monthly Total Expenses"</strong> and <strong>"Annual Total Expenses"</strong> fields in the calculator, helping you accurately project costs.
    </p>
  <p class="mt-4">
<strong>Example:</strong> If you project $200,000 in annual gross revenue, the calculator can factor in a 50-60% expense ratio to show you the remaining income available for debt payments and profit.
</p>

      className="mb-8"
    />

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">2. Account for Seasonal Revenue Fluctuations</h3>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Campgrounds often experience seasonal highs and lows. Kyle shares: <em>"Our campground is seasonal… in the winter, it's obviously way slower. But during peak season, we can generate on the low end $15,000 a month and on the high end $30,000 or a little more."</em>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      The <strong>"Campground Open Months Per Year"</strong> field in the calculator allows users to account for these seasonal variations. For example, entering "9 months" instead of a full year will adjust the revenue projections to reflect a realistic operating schedule if you're in the upper Midwest.
    </p>
  
    <p class="mt-4">
    <strong>Example:</strong> If you rent sites for $40 per night during peak months and $20 per night during slower months, the calculator can estimate your <strong>Monthly Gross Revenue</strong> and <strong>Annual Gross Revenue</strong> based on these variable rates.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8">3. Leverage Diverse Revenue Streams</h3>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Kyle highlights the value of adding amenities and services to boost income: <em>"The beautiful thing about a campground is there is so much opportunity for add-ons… golf cart rentals, a little camp store, or even a restaurant."</em>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      This directly relates to the <strong>"Additional Services Revenue Per Site"</strong> field in the calculator. By entering potential revenue from extras like Wi-Fi, golf cart rentals, or firewood sales, users can project how these income streams impact their overall profitability.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>Example:</strong> If each site generates $100 per month from additional services, the calculator shows how this boosts your <strong>Annual Gross Revenue</strong> and ultimately improves metrics like <strong>Cash-on-Cash Return</strong>.
