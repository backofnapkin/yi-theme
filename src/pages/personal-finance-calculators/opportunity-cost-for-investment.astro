    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How to Use the Calculator</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Basic Inputs</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Initial Investment:</strong> Enter the amount you plan to invest or use to pay down debt.</li>
        <li><strong>Annual Return:</strong> Input the expected annual return rate of the investment you're evaluating.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Horizon:</strong> Specify the investment period in years and months that you would like money to be invested. A <a href="https://www.westernsouthern.com/investments/long-term-investments-vs-short-term-investments">long term investment</a> is considered more than 10 years and short-term is less than 3 years.</li>
        <li><strong>Tax Rate:</strong> Enter your tax rate (for qualified dividends, <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/dividend-tax-rate">tax rates</a> are typically 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on your income).</li>
        <li><strong>Inflation Rate:</strong> The calculator defaults to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/inflation-rate-by-year-7253832">4.1% based on 2023 data</a>. Keep in mind the rate of inflation changes every year so this number will never be exactly the same on a year over year basis.</li>
        <li><strong>Goal Amount:</strong> Set a target amount you'd like to reach if you have a specific goal like paying for college or saving a down-payment on a home.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-2">Advanced Features</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Debt Comparison</h3>
    <p>Toggle this option to compare investing versus paying down debt. The calculator uses current <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/credit-cards/advice/current-interest-rates/">credit card interest rates that are close to 20%</a> as a default.</p>
    
    <p class="mt-4">In my opinion, if you're paying high-interest consumer debt at this rate, it almost always makes more sense to pay off the credit cards instead of investing. It will be extremely tough to beat a 20% rate of return on your money and get a better return than simply paying off debt. It's boring, but that's how the numbers work out.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-4">Interpreting the Results</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Future Value Section</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Shows your total projected investment value based on your inputs.</li>
        <li>Displays returns after accounting for taxes.</li>
        <li>Provides the real value adjusted for inflation while you had the cash invested.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Goal Progress</h3>
    <p>The calculator compares your results to your goal amount, helping you determine if your investment strategy aligns with your objectives.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">What If Scenarios</h2>
    <p>The calculator compares your strategy with historical returns from different investment types, <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/investing/good-return-on-investment/#key-roi-stats">based on 10-year performance data</a> from BankRate:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Stocks (12.8% annual return)</li>
        <li>Real Estate (4.2% annual return)</li>
        <li>Bonds (1.5% annual return)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="font-semibold mt-3"><strong>Important Note:</strong> While historical returns are helpful for perspective, past performance does not guarantee future results. Use this as a guide, but remember that investment outcomes can and will vary.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-4">Understanding the Calculations</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Future Value Calculation:</h3>
    <p>The calculator uses the following compound interest formula:</p>
    <pre class="bg-skin-card p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto">
<code>Future Value = Initial Investment × (1 + Monthly Rate)^(Number of Months)</code>
    </pre>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Real Value Adjustment:</h3>
    <p>This is to account for inflation and the reduced purchasing power of dollars over time.</p>
    <pre class="bg-skin-card p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto">
<code>Real Value = Post-Tax Value ÷ (1 + Monthly Inflation)^(Number of Months)</code>
    </pre>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Investment Return:</h3>
    <pre class="bg-skin-card p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto">
<code>Investment Return = Future Value - Initial Investment
Tax Amount = Investment Return × (Tax Rate ÷ 100)
Post-Tax Value = Future Value - Tax Amount</code>
    </pre>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-2 mb-4">Should You Pay off High-Interest Debt or Invest?</h2>
    <p>If you have high-interest credit card debt, it acts as a heavy financial anchor, draining your money faster than most investments can grow. Paying it down first is like earning a <strong>guaranteed 20% return at the current credit card interest rates.</strong> This something even the best investments can rarely match.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">According to CBS, the average <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/credit-card-interest-rates-surging-how-to-lower-yours-now/">credit card interest rate in October, 2024</a> was a staggering 23.37%. If this is your situation, it makes even more financial sense to pay off debt instead of investing.</p>

    <ImageEmbed src="/images/payoff-debt-or-invest.jpg" alt="payoff debt or invest" description="It almost always makes sense to payoff high-interest debt versus invest." />

    <p class="mt-4">Using the opportunity cost calculator, you can easily see the difference:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Debt Service Savings:</strong> Enter $20,000 at 20% interest, and the calculator will show you the <strong>$8,000 saved in avoided interest.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Savings Option:</strong> Enter the same amount in a savings account with 4% interest, and you'll see a projected return of just <strong>$1,632.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">This stark difference demonstrates why paying off high-interest debt is the best financial move in most cases.</p>
