        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How This Calculator Works</h2>
        <p>
          This calculator helps you determine your wealth level using two key measurements established by Felix Dennis, the late multi-millionaire founder of Dennis Publishing, co-founder of Maxim magazine, and author of the book <em>How to Get Rich</em>.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Total Net Worth:</strong> Your total assets minus liabilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Liquid Wealth:</strong> Readily available cash and easily convertible assets. Note: This is the cash you’ve already paid taxes on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This dual approach provides a more nuanced understanding of one’s true financial position, as high net worth doesn’t always correlate with high liquidity.

      <!-- Assets and Liabilities Section -->
      <section class="prose prose-lg max-w-none mt-12 text-skin-base">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What to Include in Your Calculations</h2>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Liquid Assets</h3>
        <p>These are assets that can be quickly and easily converted into cash without losing much value:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Cash in bank accounts</li>
          <li>Stocks and ETFs</li>
          <li>Retirement accounts</li>
          <li>Cryptocurrency</li>
          <li>Gold, silver, and precious metals</li>
          <li>Jewelry</li>
          <li>Paid-off vehicles</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Illiquid Assets</h3>
        <p>These are assets that are valuable but can’t be quickly converted to cash. Selling them often takes time and may require finding the right buyer:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Real estate</li>
          <li>Raw land</li>
          <li>Farm land</li>
          <li>Fine art</li>
          <li>Privately held business value</li>
          <li>Royalties</li>
          <li>Pensions</li>
          <li>Family trusts</li>
          <li>Structured notes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Liabilities</h3>
        <p>
          Liabilities are the debts and financial obligations you owe. This includes mortgages, student loans, credit card debt, and any other outstanding loans. Subtracting liabilities from your total assets gives a clearer picture of your net worth.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Wealth Categories and Their Meanings</h2>
        <p>
          Felix Dennis’s wealth categories, originally published in 2006, provide a snapshot of financial standing, adjusted here for inflation. Using data from the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" class="hover:underline">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, the categories have been updated to reflect a 70% increase in value due to inflation over the past two decades.
