## About Website & Me 

Welcome to BackofNapkin.co! I created this website with a simple goal: to help entrepreneurs make faster and more accurate projections for their new business ideas. This early phase of business planning, often done on the back of a napkin is one of the most important steps any entrepreneur can take. Going through this process helps entrepreneurs understand whether a business idea is financially viable and gives you a clearer sense of the numbers that will drive the business.

Before I start any venture, I always grab a pen and paper to sketch out different projections. I love going through the process of writing down key inputs and watching how adjustments to sales, costs, and profit margins affect the bottom line.

### My Goal

My goal here is to launch a new tool each day that makes projections easier for business owners by offering accurate, easy-to-use online tools and calculators. I research the data behind every tool and consult industry experts to ensure the numbers reflect real-world business scenarios and inputs.

My hope is that these resources will give you the confidence to move forward with your business idea or make adjustments. In many cases, you may discover a business idea doesn’t make sense based on the numbers. That's okay! I hope that I can help some founders avoid major financial setbacks investing in a new business that doesn’t make financial sense.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the tools here helpful as you start your next venture!
