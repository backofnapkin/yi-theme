        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How to use this calculator</h2>
        <p>
          This dental practice calculator helps you understand the financial side of running a dental practice. 
          I built this tool using industry research and national averages to provide realistic starting points 
          for many of the default calculations and cited my sources below.
        </p>

        <p class="font-semibold mt-4">Start by entering the basics into this tool:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Your practice name</li>
          <li>Number of dental chairs (industry research shows practices vary widely here)</li>
          <li>Patients per chair daily (default: 10 patients, based on industry average of <a href="https://medicalmarketingguru.com/blog/whats-average-patient-base-dental-professional-needs">8-15 patients per day</a>)</li>
          <li>Average revenue per patient (default: $432, based on <a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/dental-health-report">ValuePenguin's national dental health report</a>)</li>

        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Staff and Wages</h3>

        <p>The calculator will give you the following outputs that can be printed or saved in a CSV file:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Monthly and yearly revenue projections (aligned with <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/965365/patient-visits-among-all-dentists-us-per-year/">Statista's reporting</a> of approximately 3,800 patient visits per dentist annually)</li>

          <li>Projected profits</li>
          <li>Investment recovery timeline</li>
          <li>Visual expense breakdowns</li>
          <li><strong>Three scenarios:</strong> expected, best case, and conservative estimates</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Examining Dental Practice Revenue</h2>
        <p>
          While this dental practice calculator helps crunch the numbers, <a href="https://www.hellotend.com/leadership/dr-chris-salierno">Dr. Chris Salerno</a>, 
          of <a href="https://www.thecuriousdentist.com/about">The Curious Dentist</a> and the Chief Dental Officer at Tend, 
          emphasizes that when it comes to practice profitability: the timing of revenue can matter as much as the amount when 
          it comes to paying your bills on time.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Here are a few nuances the calculator won't tell you about operating a dentist office: insurance reimbursements can 
          take 30-90 days to hit your bank account, while cash patients pay on the spot. This timing differential can make or 
          break a new practice's cash flow even when the raw numbers look solid on paper.

        <div class="mt-8">
          <p>Here are a few nuances to keep in mind based on the Mastering Dental Economics presentation with Chris:</p>
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Don't just look at top line revenue.</strong> "The famous statistic is that <a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/careers/career-transitions/articles/talk-to-3-banks-the-first-step-in-buying-a-dental-practice">less than 1% of dental practices in the U.S. default</a> on their loan... However, the other side of that is just because a practice isn't failing doesn't mean it's successful," Salerno notes.</li>
            <li><strong>Find the Profit Sweet Spot:</strong> Salerno breaks down the target overhead ranges by specialty: "Research shows the average overhead for a practice in the U.S. can be as high as 70 or 75 percent... many consultants would say that a good target for general dentists could be closer to maybe sixty percent overhead taking home 40 percent."</li>
            <li><strong>Staff Costs:</strong> "From a business standpoint, it's the largest part of your overhead is how is your team members and you compensate them that is the number one line item," Salerno states.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p class="mt-8"><strong>The Bottom Line:</strong> While the calculator provides a starting framework for financial planning, Salerno's insights remind us that successful dental practices need to balance the raw numbers with real-world timing of cash flows. A practice showing $100,000 monthly revenue might only see $70,000 of that in the first month with insurance reimbursements trickling in over the following months.</p>
