    introduction: `
      Quitting smoking is not only good for your health, but your financial well-being. 
      The average smoker could spend thousands of dollars per year on cigarettes alone. 
      This calculator helps you visualize exactly how much money you could save by quitting smoking, 
      and how those savings could grow if invested wisely.

    healthBenefits: `

    financialImpact: `
      The financial cost of smoking extends beyond just the price of cigarettes. Smokers often pay 
      higher insurance premiums, have increased healthcare costs, and may spend more on cleaning, 
      maintenance, and replacing items damaged by smoke. By quitting smoking, you eliminate these 
      hidden costs while also preserving the value of your possessions and potentially reducing future 
      healthcare expenses.
    `,
    investmentGrowth: `
      When you reinvest the money saved from quitting smoking even a modest annual return can transform your savings into a substantial sum over time. 
      This calculator shows you how your savings could grow with various investment strategies, 
      helping you plan for a smoke-free and financially secure future.

    faqs: [
      {
        question: "How much money can I save by quitting smoking?",
        answer: "The amount saved depends on how many cigarettes you smoke daily and the cost per pack in your region. The average pack-a-day smoker in the US (at $8 per pack) saves about $2,920 per year by quitting."
      },
      {
        question: "How is the investment growth calculated?",
        answer: "The calculator uses compound interest calculations assuming monthly contributions (your daily smoking cost multiplied by days per month) and your chosen annual return rate, compounded monthly."
      },
      {
        question: "What's a realistic investment return rate to use?",
        answer: "Historical average returns have been around 7-10% for diversified stock market investments (before inflation), while savings accounts and bonds typically offer lower returns with less risk (1-5%). The default 10% is optimistic but within historical ranges for long-term equity investments."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I account for inflation in my calculations?",
        answer: "The calculator doesn't explicitly factor in inflation. For a more conservative estimate that accounts for inflation, you might want to reduce your expected return rate by 2-3% from historical averages."
      },
      {
        question: "How accurate are these projections?",
        answer: "The calculations provide reasonable estimates based on consistent savings and returns. Actual results may vary due to changes in smoking habits, cigarette prices, investment performance, and economic conditions over time."
